Installation
------------

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'undo-wrapper'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install undo-wrapper


Usage
-----

`Undo::wrapper` allows to wrap object in decorator:

    decorated_object = Undo.wrap object
    decorated_object.destroy
    Undo.restore decorated_object.uuid

decorated_object is a pure decorator, so it quacks like original
object. The Undo will store object state on each hit to mutation
methods such as `update`, `delete`, `destroy`. Those methods can be
changed either in place or using global configuration.

`store_on` defines a list of methods which may mutate object state.
For each hit to such methods `Undo.store` will be called.

By default `store_on` are `update`, `delete`, `destroy`. To
append custom `store_on` use:

    Undo::Wrapper.configure do |config|
      config.store_on += [:put, :push, :pop]
    end

    Undo.wrap object, store_on: [:delete, :destroy]

Or in place:

    Undo.wrap object, store_on: :save

Any option, that is not recognized by the Undo as configuration
option, will be bypass to the serializer and storage adapter:

    Undo.wrap post, include: :comments, expires_in: 1.hour
